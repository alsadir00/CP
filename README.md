# 🖥️ DSA & Competitive Programming Practice

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **Competitive Programming** repository!  
This repo documents my daily journey of solving algorithmic problems to strengthen my problem-solving skills and prepare for coding competitions.

---

## 🚀 Daily Routine
- Solve **at least 2 problems every day**:
  - **1 from Codeforces**
  - **1 from LeetCode**
- Focus on **algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques**.
- Track progress, solutions, and learning notes.
